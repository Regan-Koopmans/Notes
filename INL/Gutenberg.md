When the Gutenberg. We see a similar narative with the rise of the Internet, and massively distributed information. We can draw parallels between these two times, and using history anticipate the future.

When the Gutenberg Press was invented and books began to be mass-produced, many individuals found new opportunities for self-study, and had less dependency of personally disseminated information and apprenticeships for self-development. Similarly today we have the situation where anyone connected to the Internet can involve themselves in online courses, and develop themselves in a dynamic way that is not directly dependent on individuals or institutions.

Further, the rise of wide-spread book printing lead to stronger collaboration across time and space. Academics in one part of the world may publish one idea, and someone else in another part of the world may read this and build upon it at a much faster rate. We see this in modern times too. At this point in time, hundreds of academic articles are published per day, many of which are instantly availible through the Internet. Services exist that allow people to collaborate on works across the world in real time, which means that ideas have the potential to spread increadibly fast. The fidelity of data capturing today means that humans hundreds of years in the future may see our faces and hear our voices the same as we would hear them today, which is a rather bizarre thought.

Many books that existed before the Gutenberg press have been lost forever. It is only through mass producing that copies of books have truly survived, as the multitude and ability to create new copies has made the information in books more resilliant. Similarly through the use of the internet we have been able to archive and document in great accuracy, and where those documents may have been once at threat on one computer, they are now safer on the internet as a greater collective.
