###<span style="color:lightblue">Dependence</span>
**Data Dependence** - This means that the system is tightly coupled to the database it works on, the database is hardcoded and the system expects certain conditions to run in.

**Structural Dependence** - This means that the database cannot work unless it is in a specific management system and therefore cannot be easily transfered between destinct systems.


###<span style="color:lightblue">Data Issues</span>

**Data redundancy** - When we have the same data in multiple places unnecessarily.
**Data inconsistancy**  - Conficting versions of data in different places.
**Data anomalies** - When changes in an update/insert/delete are not completed correctly.
