#Recusion

##Tail Recursion

**Tail Recursion ** is when we have only one recursive call in the function and 
this is the last statement in the function.

##Non-Tail Recurison

**Non-tail Recursion**, as one would expect is 

##Indirect Recursion

##Nested Recursion

**Nested recursion** is when the parameter of a recursive call is anotherrecursive call. As one can imaging these functions tend to explode in computational time and complexity.
